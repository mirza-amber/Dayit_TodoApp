Inside the map function write a condition to check if your 'checkboxobject' is checked or not, you can do this by using 'checkboxobject.checked == true/false', 
now the complete condition should be something like this 
(checkboxobject.checked == false ||item.iscompleted == true')

Here, 'item' is the iteration of the map function.
And Replace the 'checkboxobject' with actual reference to your checkbox element (you can do this by useRef hook)

NOTE :
Javascript reads this condition as:
Condiiton1 || Condition2:
Now, JS will never check Condition 2 if Condition1 is satisfied. 
If checkbox is not checked, condition1 (checkboxobject.checked == false) will be True.

Now when you click on your checkbox it will be activated, and condition1 will become False. (Now you are supposed to show Task that are completed.)
then the JS will check for second condiiton2, Now second condition will only allow the iterations in which iscompleted == true.
